# omdb-linker
I used chatgpt to make this I don't know how to code

This is a script for tampermonkey that adds a button on an osu beatmap page bringing you to the omdb page for said beatmap.

There is also a script that does the same function but instead brings you to the assets page for the beatmapset background artwork.

and also a script that copies Artist - Title onto your clipboard.

tutorial!!!!!: 

1: get tampermonkey here; https://www.tampermonkey.net/

2: press the create a new script button

3: copypaste omdb linker.js

4: youre done! !!
